# Contributing

Thanks for the interest in helping to improve the projects I work on!

If you have improvements you would like to contribute,
open a PR on any of my projects,
and I'll try to dignify your efforts with a response as soon as I can.

Contributions are absolutely welcome and much appreciated,
but I provide no guarantees that I will respond quickly or merge your changes.
If you would like to guage whether I would be open to merging some changes before implementing them,
feel free to open an issue on the project.

If you are interested in co-maintaining any of my projects, please reach out to me!
I am willing to re-list many of my projects under a shared organization,
if anyone would find that desirable.

Please try your best to maintain good security practices and avoid breaking existing functionality.

If you have any questions, ping me on:

Thanks in advance!
