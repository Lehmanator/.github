# Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover:

- Security vulnerabilities
- Suspicious behavior
- Exposed credentials

involving any of my projects, domains, or hosts, please privately report them via:

- Email: [security@samlehman.dev](mailto:security@samlehman.dev)
- Matrix: [@Lehmanator:tchncs.de](https://matrix.to/#/@Lehmanator:tchncs.de)

I will work to fix any issues reported here as soon as possible.

Thank you!
